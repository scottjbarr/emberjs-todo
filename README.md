# EmberJS TODO

This is the Ember.js version of the [TodoMVC application](http://todomvc.com/)

The Ember.js version is documented in the
[Getting Started](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/) guide.

The differences between this version, and the guide on the site are that I
started the app with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), and added the Javascript
dependencies with [Bower](http://bower.io/).

## Setting Up

If starting from a clean slate, these steps get a bare bones webapp start
using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

    npm install -g yo
    npm install -g generator-webapp
    mkdir emberjs-todo
    cd emberjs-todo
    yo webapp

Now install the dependencies.

If you're cloning this repo and you already  only need to execute the last line `bower install`

    npm install && bower install


## Running

    grunt server

## Copyright

I have no claims to this code.

## License

Feel free to learn from this, but as far as commericial use goes you
should probably research that yourself. I don't know if Ember.js TODO can
be used commercially.
